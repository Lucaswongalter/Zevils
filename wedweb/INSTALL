Database
========

The database for RSVPs must be a MySQL database.  To populate the initial
schema, create a database under whatever name you want, and run "schema.sql"
in it.

Configuration file
==================

The configuration file goes in the home directory of whatever user PHP runs
as.  The file must be called .wrsvp, and it is a JSON document.

Example:

{
  "dbconfig": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "pass": "",
    "db": "wedding"
  },
  "admin_pass": "SooperSekrit!",
  "rss_pass": "not_quite_so_sekrit"
}
