<dd>
<p>
We were both Computer Science students at Brandeis, but we almost managed to finish our collegiate careers without meeting (and thwart both families' tradition of meeting spouses in school.) We'd had a few classes together, but never really spoke to each other.  That summer, we ran into each other a few times at parties and social gatherings with mutual friends, and eventually decided to meet up to see the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/museum/">MIT museum</a>, since the summer had gotten sort of long and boring.
</p>

<p>
After discovering that we had been able to make the day at the museum far from boring, we went out a few more times before Matthew left Boston for close to a month of family vacation and business travel. During that time, we continued to get to know each other &ldquo;the old-fashioned way&rdquo; &mdash; by letter. We wrote back and forth in emails of epic length, and resolved to get together again as soon as Matthew returned from his travels. Soon we found ourselves booking tickets to visit the Sachs family at Thanksgiving, and the Gifford family at Christmas. Over the next six months, we both finished our Masters&rsquo; and took jobs in Boston.</p>

<p>Soon, decisions about careers turned to more personal decisions, and an engagement soon followed. We decided give each other coordinating engagement rings; we felt that for us, purchasing rings for each other and both wearing them rather than the traditional single engagement ring was a good symbol of the equal partnership we hope to share for a very long time.

<dd>
<p>Liz was born in Silicon Valley, and lived with her parents for a short time in California and Minnesota  before settling in Texas for about 15 years.  Despite the lengthy duration in Texas, she still harbors love for technology and snow that undoubtably stem from the brief stints in other states.  She did acquire a great love for Tex-Mex over the years, but never managed to pick up a Southern accent, so you probably wouldn&rsquo;t guess where she grew up from talking to her!</p>

<p>After a high school career filled with marching band, competitive Lincoln-Douglas debate and Science Olympiad (with a class or two here and there), she headed back north for college at Brandeis University.  There, she majored in computer science while also being active in the Neuroscience department by taking several classes and working in a lab.  She loved neuroscience, artificial intellignce, and human-computer interaction, and strived to combine her interest in all of these fields with a 5th year at Brandeis spent earning her Master&rsquo;s.  While at Brandeis, she also spent several years studying the Japanese language, and gaining an appreciation for Japanese culture.  After graduating in May 2007, she accepted a position as a software engineer at Unica, inc.</p>

<p>Hobbies include the computer (even at home), cooking and a huge amount of knitting.  She adopted a black kitten named Tabitha (Tabi, to us) in August 2006, who never fails to keep life interesting at home.  Luckily for everyone, Tabi seems to think Matthew is one of the greatest people ever!</p>

<p>You can catch up with Liz&rsquo;s latest knitting projects and other happenings on her blog: <a href="http://blog.blacktabi.com/">BlackTabi Blog</a>  </p>

Elizabeth&rsquo;s parents are Dave and Jean; her brothers are Alexander (Alex)  and Isaac.  Dave grew up in a military family, living in South Carolina, Germany and Florida before settling in the eastern suburbs of Denver, Colorado.  Jean grew up in the western Denver suburbs.  When it came time for college, the red tile roofs of the University of Colorado beckoned and Dave and Jean met over circuit theory class notes that turned into something just a little bit more.  After graduation, Silicon Valley offered jobs and a change of scenery.  Jean and Dave were married in August of 1982.</p>

<p>Ever a cooperative child, Elizabeth put in her appearance on the very first day of Jean&rsquo;s scheduled maternity leave, February 6, 1984.  At the time, Dave worked for Advanced Micro Devices as a product engineer and Jean worked as a process engineer for Memorex.  Naturally, Elizabeth was beautiful and brilliant!</p>

<p>As housing prices in California were skyrocketing and since we had no real ties to the area, we began to consider our options, and the best option that presented itself was Honeywell in Minneapolis, MN.  We flew into Minnesota in a blizzard (the airport shut down an hour after our plane landed), Thanksgiving weekend of 1985 and lived there just long enough to build a house, discover the joys of being able to have one parent home full time and form a lifelong attachment to Canada Geese.  </p>

<p>Summer of 1987 offered a career advancement for Dave, back at AMD, but this time, in San Antonio, Texas.  We packed up Elizabeth, age 3 and our recently acquired black-and-white cat, Sam, and settled in as Texans in time to welcome Alex into the family in 1988.  Isaac followed two years later.  Dave continued in the semiconductor industry and Jean dabbled in every sort of volunteer work she could find.</p>

<p>In 1996, a new opportunity arose for Dave at Samsung in Austin, so we packed up 3 kids and 2 cats and moved 90 miles north.  Jean jumped right into school and church activities and Dave and Jean found niches as science coaches for school science competitions.  As the kids grew older, the days began to grow long for Jean, so she tested out the waters of education as a substitute teacher.</p>

<p>Elizabeth neared graduation as an accomplished debater.  A couple of summers earlier, a pair of debate camp coaches from Brandeis University urged her to consider Brandeis when it came time for college.  A debate tournament at Harvard whetted her appetite for the big city, public transportation and cold winters.  In August of 2002, Elizabeth moved to Boston and never looked back.  </p>

<p>Two Christmases ago, she brought this guy named Matt home with her and they proceeded to introduce the family to the tradition of the Latke (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not latkes unless there&rsquo;s a fire!&rdquo;)</p>

<p>As for the rest of the family, Jean decided that education was really where she was meant to be, started the process of teacher certification last year and now teaches high school physics.  Dave took a leap of faith last fall and began work for a small startup semiconductor company as employee #5.  Alex is in his second year at the University of Texas where he&rsquo;s enjoying philosophy and photography, and Isaac will graduate from high school this May and is thinking of a degree in marine biology.</p>

<p>A Fall wedding in New England will make life just about perfect!</P>

Matthew&rsquo;s proud parents are Randi and Danny Sachs and his equally proud brothers are Evan and Jeffrey. Randi and Danny met in college at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany when Randi was just a freshman and Danny was a senior. They met at a party and soon became inseparable.  Four years later shortly after Randi graduated from NYU (where she had transferred to be closer to Danny and also to study journalism) they were married. The date was August 19, 1978.</p>
<p>Danny began his career coding computer programs. His first job was for R.H. Macy&rsquo;s in Herald Square where we took part in the Thanksgiving Day Parade dressed as clowns, and next he worked for the now-defunct Manufacturer&rsquo;s Hanover. He currently works as a computer manager for State Street, which is headquartered in Boston, but his office is in downtown Manhattan. After a few false starts, including a brief stint as an editor at &ldquo;Master Detective&rdquo; magazine, Randi began a writing and editorial career in trade journalism, specifically in the management field. Matthew&rsquo;s arrival began a twelve-year period at home with the kids, where she continued writing management material, Randi then went back into the workforce full time as a public relations officer. She is currently Communications Manager at Whitsons Culinary Group, a food service organization, and has found an exception to the old saying that &ldquo;there is no such thing as a free lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After about four years of marriage, their friends starting having babies. It seemed like an epidemic. We figured, as long as we&rsquo;re going to be around babies so much, we might as well have one of our own. Randi&rsquo;s goal was to have &ldquo;a little Danny,&rdquo; since she had missed knowing him in childhood, and miracle of miracles, on March 20, 1984 a son was born. Matthew Gabriel Sachs was named after grandparents Max and Mickey and Goldie and Gertrude. He&rsquo;s the groom, so you can read about him in his own section.</p>
<p>Randi and Danny will be celebrating their 30th anniversary in August and are thrilled to be finally adding a daughter (Liz) after raising three wonderful sons. (Check out our license plate, it reads BOYSRUS3.) We live in Merrick (Long Island), NY. Middle son Evan, 20, is currently a junior at SUNY Albany (sound familiar?) and is studying psychology and math. Youngest son Jeffrey, 16 going on 17, is a junior in high school and is greatly involved in an intensive four-year drama program. He recently had his first leading role in a musical and he was, well, magnificent. He hopes to continue to study and get a degree in theater, but he has promised to complete a double major to have the academic degree to fall back on &ldquo;just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sachs family could not be complete without a mention of our two cats, Baby and Surge. Baby, a black and white behemoth is a loving and friendly fellow who seems to have the sort of metabolism that likes to hold onto calories. Surge is a long-haired orange cat with a propensity for biting people on the leg with razor-sharp teeth. We also have a pair of leopard geckos, who don&rsquo;t do much of anything but hang out in their tank.</p>
<p>We are all very excited about Matthew and Elizabeth&rsquo;s wedding. Liz fits very comfortably into our family and most of all, we have never known Matthew to be happier. It&rsquo;s a perfect match!
